Heya!
	For proper visit of the project, first of all extract the file folder and consider it as the master folder.
	Later create another folder named "img" in the 'file' folder.
        Now extract the image1,image2 and image3 folders and cut their folder contents and paste those category wise image folders directly into the img folder.
